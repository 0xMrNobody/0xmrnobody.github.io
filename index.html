                            Agent software is installed on endpoints to forward logs to the server for analysis. For endpoints that donâ€™t have an agent package, configured log forwarding to the Wazuh server.</p>

                    <button class="collapsible">Password Generator | Python</button>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>This is a program I wrote in Python which will generate any number of passwords at a desired length and complexity. The idea behind this isn't to necessarily produce extremely random or secure passwords, but rather to generate many "random-enough" passwords and building a rainbow table based off of those results to attempt to crack. It is interesting to see how much computational power is needed to attempt a brute-force, even when you know the algorithm or library used to generate the passwords. The program also checks for duplicates, which actually happen more often than I would have thought, even for basic randomness libraries, which illustrates the importance of entropy when creating secure passwords.</p>

                        <p>This is a Security Policy that I wrote and actually use with my family and roommates. It outlines protocols, procedures, tools, and technologies for everyone to leverage which will help them with achieving the best possible CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Accessibility) for their data. It also provides a plan and action steps in case of a data disaster so that we can avoid loss and continue operating in our daily lives after an event. Finally, it also addresses risks and trade-offs that should be considered when using the tools so that users are empowered to implement solutions that work best for them, within the framework of the overall security posture.</p>
